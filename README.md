AntiTaintDroid (a.k.a. ScrubDroid)
----------------------------------

[AntiTaintDroid][1] (a.k.a. [ScrubDroid][2]) is a proof-of-concept Android application offering a working implementation of the [techniques presented in our paper][3] at [SECRYPT 2013][4] which can be exploited to bypass the security protections offered by [TaintDroid][5], a real-time privacy monitoring mechanism based on dynamic taint analysis.

###Quick Installation Guide###

If you don't want to be hassled with compiling the app yourself, you may just follow the workflow below:

```sh
  git clone git@github.com:gsbabil/AntiTaintDroid.git # checkout my source-code
  cd AntiTaintDroid # change current directory to AntiTaintDroid
  adb install bin/AntiTaintDroid.apk # install the app on your phone/emulator
  cd AntiTaintDroi/AntiTaintDroid-Server # change directory to AntiTaintDroid server
  python antitaintdroid-server.py # runs the server
```

###Compiling the code###

I have included both the Eclipse and Ant project files. You should just be able to import it in Eclipse and hit the `Run` button. Or, you can just do `ant debug install` to compile and install it on your TaintDroid phone.


###How it works###

The mechanisms to bypass TaintDroid protections are [elaborated in our paper][2]. Also, the code itself if pretty self-explanatory. Just go through `UntaintTricks.java` and you should be fine. You should note that the way this PoC app works is - first it collects some private information (e.g. IMEI, Android ID etc.) from the phone with `collectPrivateData()` and then it tries to leak it over the network. Where the data is leaked to depends on where you run the server component. AntiTaintDroid PoC comes with a simple Python server which you can find in `AntiTaintDroid-Server` directory. Just make sure that you `cd` inside the `AntiTaintDroid-Server` directory and then run the `python antitaintdroid-server.py` script. The server should start a very simple web-server on port `8000`. Now you can go back to the app and hit `menu > settings` to specify your server IP address and port number. That's it! Now you are ready to try all the AntiTaintDroid tricks. Each time you tap on a trick, some private data (depending on what you have in `collectPrivateData()`) should be stolen, leaked to your server (`antitaintdroid-server.py` will print it on the console) and of course there won't be any TaintDroid notification to alert you that your IMEI has just been stolen. Cheers!
